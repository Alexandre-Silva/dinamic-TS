# dynamic-TS
A TeamSpeak server maintained dynamically between a set of users. The server is
hosted in the users' machines were at any given time instant there is only one
active server instance. The server is discover-able using DDNS (in this case
no-ip.com).

This is a really old project. Just archiving it here.
